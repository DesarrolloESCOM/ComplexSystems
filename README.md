# ComplexSystems
Subject practices, scripts and projects.

# What do I need?

* Just a java 1.6 or higher.
* A shell (cmd could be fine to!)
* Mongodb server instance (2.7 or higher)
* Gradle (gradle wrapper added).

# How could I run a homework/practice?

### Step 0: Clone the project in your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pepo27/DSD.git
```
or simply download the zip file and extract it.

### Step 1: Enter into Practices directory and run gradle for solving all the dependencies.

```bash
$ ./gradlew 
```
### Step 2: Look into gradle tasks.

```bash
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
This will show all the tasks, considering Simulators, Exploration, Insertion and Statistics generation for all the practices and projects. Like the next code:

```
CreateDiffusioNRuleStatistics - Generate GameOfLife statistics from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75
CreateGameOfLifeStatistics - Generate GameOfLife statistics from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75
CreateMicroWorldStatistics - Generate MicroWorld statistics 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
Diffusion_5x5_1 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 1 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_2 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 2 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_3 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 3 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_4 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 4 of 4
Generator_DiffusionRule_4x4 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_DiffusionRule_5x5 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_GoL_4x4 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_GoL_5x5 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
GoL_5x5_1 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 1 of 4
GoL_5x5_2 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 2 of 4
GoL_5x5_3 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 3 of 4
GoL_5x5_4 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 4 of 4
MicroWorldSimulation - Start the simulation of a microworld
StartSimulator - Start a simulation of the game of life
```

All the insertion tasks will require **Mongo** to be running on your computer. This tasks are used for saving all the states generated by the **Diffusion Rule** and the **Game of Life** using a 4x4 and 5x5 matrix. You may need to consider to run this tasks using separated terminals, they will take a lot of time, just imagine! 2 ^ 25 just to explore all the possible combinations using the Game Of Life process!

If you are brave enough, I totally recommend you to load the file *opts.sh* on your system's environment. This options will tune up the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) using server configurations, a lot of memory and take advantage of a simple and poor link between the video card and the JVM (just relevant if you're running the simulators).

### Step 3: Finally, look for a task and then run it!, for example:

```bash
$ ./gradlew StartSimulator
```
```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```
# What about the docs? 

You may need LaTex to be installed on your machine, enter into the TexFiles directory and run 
```
pdflatex main.tex
```
