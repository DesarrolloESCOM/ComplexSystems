# ComplexSystems
Subject practices, scripts and projects.

# What do I need?

* Just a java 1.6 or higher.
* A shell (cmd could be fine to!)
* Mongodb server instance (2.7 or higher)
* Gradle (gradle wrapper added).
* 
## How could I run a homework/practice?

Step 0: Clone the project in your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pepo27/DSD.git
```
or simply download the zip file and extract it.

Step 1: Enter into Practices directory and run gradle for solving all the dependencies.

```bash
$ ./gradlew 
```

Step 2: Look into gradle tasks.

```bash
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
This will show all the tasks, considering Simulators, Exploration, Insertion and Statistics generation for all the practices and projects. Like the next code:

```bash
------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.
buildDependents - Assembles and tests this project and all projects that depend on it.
buildNeeded - Assembles and tests this project and all projects it depends on.
classes - Assembles classes 'main'.
clean - Deletes the build directory.
jar - Assembles a jar archive containing the main classes.
testClasses - Assembles classes 'test'.

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build. [incubating]
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files. [incubating]

Documentation tasks
-------------------
groovydoc - Generates Groovydoc API documentation for the main source code.
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

Help tasks
----------
components - Displays the components produced by root project 'GameOfLife'.
dependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'GameOfLife'.
dependencyInsight - Displays the insight into a specific dependency in root project 'GameOfLife'.
help - Displays a help message
projects - Displays the sub-projects of root project 'GameOfLife'.
properties - Displays the properties of root project 'GameOfLife'.
tasks - Displays the tasks runnable from root project 'GameOfLife'.

IDE tasks
---------
cleanEclipse - Cleans all Eclipse files.
cleanIdea - Cleans IDEA project files (IML, IPR)
eclipse - Generates all Eclipse files.
idea - Generates IDEA project files (IML, IPR, IWS)

Verification tasks
------------------
check - Runs all checks.
test - Runs the unit tests.

Other tasks
-----------
cleanIdeaWorkspace
console
CreateDiffusioNRuleStatistics - Generate GameOfLife statistics from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75
CreateGameOfLifeStatistics - Generate GameOfLife statistics from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75
CreateMicroWorldStatistics - Generate MicroWorld statistics 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
Diffusion_5x5_1 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 1 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_2 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 2 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_3 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 3 of 4
Diffusion_5x5_4 - Insertion job for 5x5 Diffusion 4 of 4
Generator_DiffusionRule_4x4 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_DiffusionRule_5x5 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_GoL_4x4 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
Generator_GoL_5x5 - Dot file generation GoL 4x4
GoL_5x5_1 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 1 of 4
GoL_5x5_2 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 2 of 4
GoL_5x5_3 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 3 of 4
GoL_5x5_4 - Insertion job for 5x5 GoL 4 of 4
MicroWorldSimulation - Start the simulation of a microworld
StartSimulator - Start a simulation of the game of life

```

All the insertion tasks will require **Mongo** to be running on your computer. This tasks are used for saving all the states generated by the **Diffusion Rule** and the **Game of Life** using a 4x4 and 5x5 matrix. You may need to consider to run this tasks using separated terminals, they will take a lot of time, just imagine! 2 ^ 25 just to explore all the possible combinations using the Game Of Life process!

If you are brave enough, I totally recommend you to load the file *opts.sh* on your system's environment. This options will tune up the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) using server configurations, a lot of memory and take advantage of a simple and poor link between the video card and the JVM (just relevant if you're running the simulators).

Finally, look for a task and then run it!, for example:

```bash
$ ./gradlew StartSimulator
```
```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```
