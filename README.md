## How could I run a homework/practice?

Step 0: Clone the project in your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pepo27/DSD.git
```
or simply download the zip file and extract it.

Step 1: Run gradle for solving all the dependencies.

```bash
$ ./gradlew 
```

Step 2: Look into gradle tasks.

```bash
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
Look for a task and then run it!, for example:

```bash
$ ./gradlew StartSimulator
```
```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```
